= Angular + Auth0 Demo Steps

If you're developing an Angular app today, you might need a way to authenticate your users. That's where OpenID Connect (OIDC) can help you. OIDC is a layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides identity.

In this tutorial, I'll how you to add OIDC authentication with Auth0 to a new Angular app in just a few steps.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] v14

toc::[]

== Create an Angular app

. Create a new Angular app with routing enabled:

    npx @angular/cli@13 new auth0-demo --routing

== Add Auth with OpenID Connect

. Install the https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation[Auth0 CLI] and run `auth0 login` to register your account.

. Run `auth0 apps create`. Specify a name and description of your choosing.

. Select **Single Page Web Application** and use `http://localhost:4200/home` for the Callback URL. Specify `http://localhost:4200` for the rest of the URLs.

. Use https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular--auth0[OktaDev Schematics] to add OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to your Angular app.

    ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0

. View changes using `git diff` or in https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-angular-example/pull/1/files[this pull request].

.Use the Auth0 Console instead of the CLI
****
You can also use the Auth0 Console to create an OIDC app:

* https://auth0.com/auth/login[Log in] to Auth0 or https://auth0.com/signup[create an account] if you don't have one. Go to **Applications** > **Create Application**.
* Choose **Single Page Web Applications** as the application type and click **Create**.
* Click **Angular**, then the **Settings** tab.
* Add `http://localhost:4200/home` as an Allowed Callback URL and `http://localhost:4200` as a Logout URL.
* Specify `http://localhost:4200` as an Allowed Origin and click **Save Changes** at the bottom.
****

=== Test your Angular authentication flow

. Run `ng serve` and you'll see a login button at `http://localhost:4200/home`.

. Show authentication flow.

=== Display the authenticated user's name

To display the authenticated user's name, you can use the `user$` observable on the `AuthService` instance.

. Modify `src/app/home/home.component.html` to display a welcome message to the user.

<div>
  <button *ngIf="(auth.isAuthenticated$ | async) === false"
          (click)="login()" id="login">Login</button>
  <div *ngIf="auth.user$ | async as user">
    <h2>Welcome, {{user?.name}}!</h2>
  </div>
  <button *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated$ | async"
          (click)="logout()" id="logout">Logout</button>
</div>

. Refresh your app, and you should see your name displayed.

== Angular FTW!
